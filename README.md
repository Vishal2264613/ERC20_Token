## Introduction

MyERC20Token is a fully compliant ERC20 token smart contract, designed to demonstrate how to create, manage, and interact with Ethereum-based tokens. This contract includes features like basic token transfers, allowances, and approval mechanisms.

## Features

- **Standard ERC20 Functions**: Implements all the core functions defined in the ERC20 standard.
- **Minting**: Capability to mint new tokens (if applicable).
- **Burning**: Capability to burn tokens (if applicable).
- **Allowance Management**: Allows for token spending by third parties.
- **Events**: Emits relevant events for transactions and approvals.

## Requirements

- **Solidity Version**: Compatible with Solidity version ^0.8.0.
- **Ethereum Network**: Ethereum mainnet, testnets (e.g., Ropsten, Rinkeby), or local Ethereum networks (e.g., Ganache).

## Usage

1. Copy paste the code in Remix IDE.
2. Compile it and then deploy it.
3. Start using the functions it contains!
